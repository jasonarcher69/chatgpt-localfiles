# ChatGPT Local Files Plugin

This plugin makes your local files accessible to ChatGPT via local plugin; allowing you to ask questions and interact with files via chat. Features and use-cases:

- Point to the base directory of code, allowing ChatGPT to read your existing code and any changes you make throughout the chat
- In addition to text files/code, also supports extracting text from PDF and DOCX files.

The core idea is based on something implemented in [kesor's fantastic chatgpt-code-plugin](https://github.com/kesor/chatgpt-code-plugin).
